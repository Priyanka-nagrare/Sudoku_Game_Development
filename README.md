# Sudoku_Game_Development
A Graphical User Interface for 4x4 and 9x9 Sudoku Game

# The Tasks
The tasks you are to carry out are as follows:
• Provide a full test plan and test log for both the sample code provided (to determine initial
functionality), and any further alterations made to the code.

• Complete the implementation of the text-based user interface to include the (as yet unimplemented
and therefore failed tests) clear (resetting the Sudoku game), undo (a single user move, then a further
move if called again and so on), save (the state of the game to a file) and load (the state of the game
from a file) methods. You should only need to make changes to the main user interface class (UI) and
the helper class Assign to achieve this.

• To design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Sudoku model code that allows the user to make moves, undo user moves, clear (reset) the game, save to, and load from a file. The individual slots will need to indicate whether they are empty, a player move, or a computer move. The
GUI should at least give feedback on whether the game has been won by a player or computer. The appearance of the interface is up to you, but an example is given in Figure 3 (of a game in progress). You must use observer-observable to update the GUI as the model changes.

• Write a report including design documentation for the full system, including a completed class diagram, descriptions of all classes, and any relevant design decisions made when creating the GUI; and an individual reflection covering the development of the project and evaluating the work.
